# Frederick Keune

Hello, my name is Freddi. I was born in Berlin and lived here until my early twenties. After receiving my German as well as French high school degree, I started working as a Senior Complaint Management Specialist at N26. After two years working there, I decided to move to Heidelberg and pursue studies in Digital Business Management. After getting my Bachelor's degree, I spent a year studying economics at Fernuniversität Hagen before deciding to switch to HWR and begin my studies in Business Intelligence and Process Management.
